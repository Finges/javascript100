Meteor is self-described as 'an Ultra-Simple environment for building modern web applications'
It's interesting because it sends pure JS and data over the wire instead of javascript. It
seems like it's Javascripts answer to Ruby on Rails. It'd be nice to have a library to test/build
out some test websites/web applications without needing too much engineering effort
